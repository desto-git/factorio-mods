# Steamed

Fork of the [Steamed](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Steamed) mod.

The following buildings now need steam instead of electricity:
- Assemblers (includes "Oil refinery" and "Chemical plant")
- Electric mining drills (Now called "Steam mining drill", includes "Pumpjack")
- Electric furnaces (Now called "Steam furnace")
- Labs

Should be compatible with most mods.
