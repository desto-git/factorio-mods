# Sapling Capsule

Works like a cluster grenade, but plants trees instead of pulverizing them.

Inspired by [Treenades](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Treenades), with various improvements:
- Spawns the type of tree that is closest to the target location
	- Compatible with [Alien Biomes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alien-biomes)
	- Can only plant trees close to existing trees
- Works like a cluster grenade, for more varied (organic) placement
- Prevents spawning trees on top of other entites (just like during map generation)
	- Won't spawn trees on water
- It's a late game technology (unlocked after "Military 4") and costs more to produce
- Some particle and sound effects

# Balancing notes
- The capsule costs less wood than it can provide. Reason being that if a cluster lands on an occupied spot,
the tree won't grow, thus wasting this precious, usually finite resource.
- It costs insane amounts of water because offshore pumps provide (in my opinion) insane amounts of water
- It's a late game tech and the item is expensive because trees make for some overpowered walls
