# Resource Richness Distance Multiplier

You're almost done mining your starting iron ore patch. You need to expand.
Lucky you, right next door there is an iron ore field huge enough to support your base for the rest of your life as well as that of your grandchildren.

This mod adds a bit of control on just how much richer the resource patches outside the starting area are.
It does not alter the placement of ores from vanilla. As such, the map preview still works.

If you need more control, you should stick to good ol' [RSO](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/rso-mod).
